Abstract—In this paper, machine learning algorithms such as Support Vector Machine, Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbor, Naïve Bayes, Decision Tree and Random Forest applied to the heart disease dataset to predict if a patient is ill or not. Performance of these are compared to each other by varied methods like accuracy, confusion matrix, and overall classification report. When preparing the data, necessary methods were used to fix missing and wrong values, deal with class imbalance issues and dimension reduction. All of these were implemented by using Python programming language on Jupyter Notebook.
